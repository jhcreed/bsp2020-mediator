## Mediation analysis

Examines an exposure and outcome through an intermediate variable (mediator) 

Causal relationship 
+ Understanding the mechanics behind an association 
+ NOT prediction
    
Estimate the direct and indirect effects

## Diected Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)

.w-75.h-center[
![](figures/example_dag_2.png)
]

DAGs contain variables of interest and common causes

Time ordered 

Quickly assess assocations between variables

## Classic mediation analysis

Baron and Kenny aka the product method 
+ https://www.sesp.org/files/The%20Moderator-Baron.pdf
+ Over 90,000 citations 

Criteria to be a mediator: 
+ Changing the exposure change the mediator (Race -> Access/ QoC) 
+ The mediator affect the outcome (Access / Qoc -> Lethal outcomes)
+ Changing the exposure change the outcome .accent-blue[ ( `r emo::ji("grimacing")` unless the indirect and direct effects cancel out) ]
+ After controlling for the mediator, the previously significant relationship between the exposure and the outcome is no longer significant .accent-blue[ ( `r emo::ji("grimacing")` unless it partial mediaton) ]

---

## Baron and Kenny approach 

If .accent-orange[X] is the exposure, .accent-orange[ Y ] the outcome, .accent-orange[ M ] the mediator and .accent-orange[ C ] the covariates
+ Y and M are continuous
    
Step 1: Fit E[M] = $\beta_{0}$ + $\beta_{1} a$ + $\beta_{2} c$

Step 2: Fit E[Y] = $\theta_{0}$ + $\theta_{1} a$ + $\theta_{2} m$ + $\theta_{4} c$

Direct effect = $\theta_{1} a$
+ Direct effect is the exposure effect on the outcome at a fixed level of the mediator

Indirect effect = $\theta_{2} \beta_{1}$
+ Indirect effect is the effect on the outcome of changes of the exposure which operate through the mediator

## Allowing exposure-mediator interactions

Step 1: Fit E[M] = $\beta_{0} + \beta_{1} a + \beta_{2} c$ 
+ .accent-blue[same as previously]

Step 2: Fit E[Y] = $\theta_{0} + \theta_{1} a + \theta_{2} m + \theta_{3} am + \theta_{4} c$

.accent-blue[Assuming a binary exposure changing level a^*^ = 0 to a = 1]



> Controlled direct effect = $( \theta_{0} + \theta_{3} m)(a - a^{*})$

> Natural indirect effect = $\{ \theta_{0} + \theta_{3} ( \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} a^{*} + \beta_{2} c) \}(a - a^{*})$

> Natural indirect effect = $( \theta_{2} \beta_{1} + \theta_{3} \beta_{1}a) (a - a^{*})$



`r emo::ji("point_right")` When no exposure-mediator interaction is present, $\theta_{3}$ = 0
+ CDE = NDE = $\theta_{1}$ and NIE = $\theta_{2} \beta_{1}$
+ .accent-blue[Same as the direct and indirect effects in Baron and Kenny]

---

## Interpreting the estimates

Controlled direct effect = $( \theta_{0} + \theta_{3} m)(a - a^{*})$
+ How much the outcome would change if exposure changed from a∗ to a and the mediator were controlled at level m in the population

Natural indirect effect = $\{ \theta_{0} + \theta_{3} ( \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} a^{*} + \beta_{2} c) \}(a - a^{*})$
+ How much the outcome would change if exposure were set at level a versus a∗ but for each individual the mediator were kept at the level it would have taken in the absence of exposure

Natural indirect effect = $( \theta_{2} \beta_{1} + \theta_{3} \beta_{1}a) (a - a^{*})$
+ How much the outcome would change if exposure were controlled at level a but the mediator were changed from the level it would take with a∗ to the level it would take with a

Total effect of A = NDE + NIE

NDE:  the effect of the exposure (male sex) on the outcome (overall survival) if the pathway from the exposure to the mediator (smoking status) was removed
+ HR for male sex compared to female sex, when each individuals level of smoking is kept at the level it would take in the absence of sex, is 0.80 (0.51-1.28)

## SAS, STATA and R - Oh My!

`mediator` is the sister program of `%mediator` the SAS/SPSS macro developed by Valeri and VanderWeele 

Confidence Intervals 
+ `%mediator` uses hard coded `1.96` and `-1.96` while `mediator` uses  `c(-1,1)*qnorm(.975)` for the Delta method
+ during bootstrapping, `%mediator` bootstraps effect estimates and CIs while `mediator` only bootstraps the CIs
+ minor differences due to rounding 
    
Speed differences 
+ `mediator` up to 1000x faster than `%mediator` when using bootstrapping

Covariates
+ `%mediator` uses dummy variables for multi-level factors while `mediator` allows multi-level and character variables in models 

`mediation` package
+ different set of terminology 
+ different estimation approach

---

## Package == Reproducibility

Easy to share and implement new methods

R packages are more than just a bundle of code : tests, data, documentation, ...
